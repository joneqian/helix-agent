"""Approval-gate helpers for ``tools_node`` — Stream J.8 (Mini-ADR J-24).

helix's ``tools_node`` dispatches a turn's ``tool_calls`` in parallel
stages (Stream L.L6 — ``plan_stages`` + ``asyncio.gather``). LangGraph's
native ``interrupt()`` re-runs the whole node on resume, which does not
compose cleanly with an in-flight ``gather``. After comparing with
deer-flow (whose ``ClarificationMiddleware`` returns ``Command(goto=END)``
on a serial tool loop), J.8 adopts the **end-and-resume** model:

* ``tools_node`` checks the turn's ``tool_calls`` *before* staging. If a
  call is approval-gated — either its name is in
  ``policies.approval_required_tools`` (the platform-enforced declarative
  gate) or it is the agent-initiated ``ask_for_approval`` builtin — the
  node writes an :class:`ApprovalRequest` to ``AgentState.pending_approval``
  and dispatches nothing. The graph then routes to ``END`` and the run
  ends as ``RunStatus.PAUSED`` with its checkpoint intact.
* ``POST /v1/runs/{id}/resume`` (J.8-step3) writes the human verdict
  back into the checkpoint and re-invokes the graph.

This module owns the *detection* + *request construction* — pure
functions, no graph imports, easily unit-tested.
