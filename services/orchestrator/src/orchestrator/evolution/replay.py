"""Replay-verification runner (Stream SE, SE-4b) — the 咽喉's hands.

SE-4a (:mod:`orchestrator.evolution.grounding`) is the judgment brain. This
module orchestrates the actual *replay*: for each held-out task it runs the
agent **without** the candidate skill (baseline) and **with** it (treatment),
scores both, and feeds the per-case outcomes to ``decide_grounding`` — then
persists the resulting :class:`SkillEvalResult` as the grounding evidence
(Mini-ADR SE-A0/SE-A2).

The heavy parts — building + running two real agent graphs, and a real LLM
judge — are injected behind two seams so the orchestration stays unit-testable
in CI (Mini-ADR SE-A6: CI uses fakes / scripted judge; the real graph + Haiku
judge run only under integration):

* :class:`TaskRunner` — runs one task with or without the candidate skill and
  returns the agent's answer text. The real-graph adapter (builds two
  ``AgentSpec``\\ s differing only in ``skills``, sandboxes high-risk replays)
  lands in SE-4c.
* :class:`ReplayJudge` — scores one answer 1..N. Structurally matches the eval
  harness ``JudgeProvider`` so ``ScriptedJudge`` / ``AnthropicHaikuJudge``
  satisfy it by duck typing when wired from integration.

Scoring is **pointwise** (baseline and treatment are scored independently),
which sidesteps the 60-75% position bias of pairwise LLM judges - no
swap-order needed (that mitigation only applies if a pairwise judge is used).

Held-out integrity (SPARK): a task whose ``trajectory_key`` matches the
request's ``distilled_from_trajectory_key`` is dropped before replay, so a
distilled skill is never scored against its own source trajectory.
