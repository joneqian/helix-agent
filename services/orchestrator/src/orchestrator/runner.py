"""LangGraph execution surface — the orchestrator's only graph entrypoint.

Per [STREAM-E-DESIGN § 4.1](../../../../docs/streams/STREAM-E-DESIGN.md),
``GraphRunner`` centralises the wiring between a user-supplied
:class:`langgraph.graph.StateGraph` and the shared checkpointer so that
every compiled graph in the service writes to the same durable store.

The current sub-PR (E.1) exposes only ``checkpointer`` — later sub-PRs
extend ``__init__`` with the middleware chain (E.2), audit logger (E.5),
LLM router (E.11) and tool registry (E.7+). Callers must pass keyword
arguments so future widening is non-breaking.
