"""SSE streaming — background run worker + SSE consumer (Stream E.14).

In-process monolith model (STREAM-E-DESIGN § 2.6, corrected against
deer-flow's ``gateway`` + ``runtime`` co-location). There is **no**
separate orchestrator service: the control-plane FastAPI app imports
this module, runs graphs as background ``asyncio.Task``s, and streams
their events to clients over SSE.

Two halves, decoupled by :class:`StreamBridge`:

- :func:`run_agent` — the **producer**. A background task that drives a
  compiled LangGraph graph via ``graph.astream(...)`` and publishes
  each chunk to the bridge. Cooperative cancellation: it polls
  ``record.abort_event`` between chunks (set by
  :meth:`RunManager.cancel`). Always publishes a terminal ``end`` via
  :meth:`StreamBridge.publish_end`, even on error / cancel, so no
  consumer hangs.
- :func:`sse_consumer` — the **consumer**. An async generator that
  subscribes to the bridge and yields SSE wire frames. Its ``finally``
  block implements ``on_disconnect``: when the client disconnects and
  the run's mode is :data:`DisconnectMode.CANCEL`, the run is
  cancelled.

The worker is **graph-injected** — it receives an already-compiled
graph. Assembling a graph from an agent manifest (the "agent factory")
is a separate concern out of E.14 scope.

Backpressure is the :class:`StreamBridge`'s bounded-buffer drop-oldest
(Mini-ADR E-8, M0): a consumer that falls behind resumes from the
earliest retained event. There is no cancel-on-full in M0.
