"""Run-level transient-failure retry — Stream HX-3 (STREAM-HX-DESIGN § 4).

A run whose graph execution dies on a *transient* infrastructure error
(today: the LLM fallback chain exhausting on the retryable ``LLMError``
family) gets one in-worker retry from its committed checkpoint instead
of going straight to ``RunStatus.ERROR``. Three pieces live here; the
retry loop itself is in :func:`orchestrator.sse.run_agent`:

* **Classification** (Mini-ADR HX-C1): a type registry, no text
  sniffing — the router already did the 4xx/5xx split when it decided
  whether to fall back. Unknown exceptions stay permanent: retrying a
  deterministic bug has no expected benefit.
* **Replay-safety guard** (Mini-ADR HX-C2): checkpoints commit per
  super-step, so committed history never re-executes on a continuation.
  The only replay window is the *failed* (uncommitted) step, and what
  it will re-run is fully determined by the checkpoint tail — a trailing
  ``AIMessage`` with unanswered ``tool_calls`` means exactly that batch
  re-dispatches. The guard applies the CM-B5 capability rule to that
  batch (every call ``read_only`` or ``idempotent``) and is
  **fail-closed**: repeating a side effect is beyond the fail-open
  axiom's "cost more tokens" ceiling.
* **Config** (axiom ③ — defensive parsing): env toggles clamp / fall
  back to defaults, never raise.
