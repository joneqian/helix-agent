"""Stream CM-2 — working-memory sliding window (cheap pre-compressor gate).

The agent_node preflight currently has exactly one compression gate: the
LLM-backed :class:`~orchestrator.context.compressor.ContextCompressor`,
which summarises the middle of an overflowing conversation. Every light
overflow therefore pays for a summariser LLM call. This module adds a
**cheap, LLM-free** first gate that runs *before* the compressor: when the
estimated prompt is over threshold it trims the conversation down to the
first turn plus the most-recent ``max_recent_turns`` user turns. Most light
overflows are resolved here, so the compressor (the second gate) only runs
on what is still too large after trimming. Maps the framework report's A2
(OpenClaw ``limitHistoryTurns``).

Design anchors (STREAM-CM-DESIGN §4):

* **CM-C1 — token-gated.** Trimming only happens when the estimate is at or
  over threshold; under threshold the window is a no-op, so a conversation
  that is not overflowing sees an unchanged prompt (zero behaviour change).
* **CM-C2 — cut on HumanMessage boundaries.** A ``HumanMessage`` always
  starts a fresh turn and never sits between an ``AIMessage`` tool_use and
  its ``ToolMessage`` tool_result, so slicing the suffix from a
  ``HumanMessage`` index can never split a tool-call pair (the OpenClaw
  #1084 hard constraint). No pair-repair logic is needed — cutting at the
  right boundary is the guarantee.
* **CM-C3 — keep the first turn.** Mirroring the compressor's head/tail
  philosophy, the original task turn is a cheap goal anchor kept alongside
  the recent window (complementing, not depending on, CM-0 recitation).
* **CM-C4 — prompt-view only.** Like the compressor, trimming only shapes
  the message list handed to *this* LLM call; ``agent_node`` never rewrites
  the checkpointed history, so dropped middle turns are not lost — the next
  turn reloads the full history from the checkpoint and trims afresh.
* **CM-C6 — reuse the compressor's estimator.** The token gate reuses
  :func:`~orchestrator.context.compressor.estimate_tokens` and the
  leading-SystemMessage split, keeping one estimation basis and never
  touching ``AgentState`` / ``ToolResult`` / ``ToolSpec``.
