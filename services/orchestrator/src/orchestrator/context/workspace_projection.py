"""Stream CM-0 — project authoritative agent state into workspace files.

The DB (LangGraph checkpoint + ``memory_item`` rows) is the **source of
truth**; these Markdown files are a *projection* of it into the per-user
``/workspace`` so the agent can ``read_file`` them and a human can open them
to see — and steer — the run. State flows one direction at a time
(Mini-ADR CM-A2): this module renders + writes ``DB → file`` at a turn
boundary; the inverse ``file → DB`` controlled ingest is a separate path.

**Pure core (this module)** — rendering is pure functions and
:class:`WorkspaceProjector` writes through an injected
:class:`WorkspaceFileWriter` seam, so the only-if-changed digest gate and
the best-effort contract are unit-testable without a live sandbox. The real
writer (a ``write_file`` snippet in the J.15 warm sandbox — the only channel
with workspace-volume write access, see CM-A1) is wired separately.

**Best-effort (Mini-ADR CM-A8)** — a failing write is logged and never
propagates (projection must never break a run), and the returned digest does
*not* advance past a partial failure so the next turn retries.
