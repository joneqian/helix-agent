"""``skill_view`` orchestrator tool — Capability Uplift Sprint #3
(Mini-ADRs U-17 + U-21).

When an agent is given access to one or more skills (via ``skills:`` in
its manifest), :class:`SkillViewTool` is registered as a single
``skill_view(skill_name, path)`` tool. The tool serves as the single
mental model for reading skill content:

- ``path == "SKILL.md"`` → re-pack the version's frontmatter +
  prompt_fragment into a Markdown document and return it
- ``path == "reference/foo.md"`` (or any other subdir) → look up the
  base64-encoded entry in ``supporting_files`` and return its decoded
  contents

Every read goes through the U-21 double check:

1. **Drift detection** — recompute ``content_hash`` over canonicalized
   ``(prompt_fragment, supporting_files)`` and compare against the
   stored value. Mismatch fires :func:`record_skill_drift` + a
   ``SKILL_DRIFT_DETECTED`` audit row (P0 — almost certainly SQL
   injection or internal actor) and returns a ``[BLOCKED]`` placeholder.

2. **Context-scope re-scan** — run ``scan_for_threats(content,
   scope="context")`` on the chosen content. A hit fires
   :func:`record_skill_redacted` + :func:`record_threat_pattern_hits`
   and returns a ``[BLOCKED]`` placeholder. This catches the case
   where a pattern set update adds new rules after the row was already
   imported.

Both placeholders preserve Oracle defense: the LLM sees that the
content was withheld but never sees the offending substring or the
recomputed hash.
