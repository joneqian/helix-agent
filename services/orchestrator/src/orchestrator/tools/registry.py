"""Tool Protocol + ``ToolRegistry`` — Stream E.6.

Concrete tool adapters (``web_search`` E.7, ``http`` E.8, ``mcp:*`` E.9,
``exec_python`` F.4) all implement :class:`Tool` and register here. The
ReAct graph (``orchestrator.graph_builder``) reads
:meth:`ToolRegistry.specs` to hand the LLM the list of callable tools,
and dispatches by name via :meth:`ToolRegistry.get`.

Tool ``call`` exceptions are wrapped into ``ToolMessage(error=...)`` by
the graph's ``tools`` node (per Mini-ADR E-12 in
[STREAM-E-DESIGN](../../../../../docs/streams/STREAM-E-DESIGN.md)) —
adapters can raise freely; the LLM sees the error as a tool result and
reasons about retry / different args / final answer.
