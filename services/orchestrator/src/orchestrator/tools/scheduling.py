"""Stream L.L6 — adaptive tool-call scheduling.

Walks a batch of LLM-emitted tool calls and assigns each to a *stage*:
a group of calls that may safely run concurrently. The ``tools`` node
executes one stage at a time with :func:`asyncio.gather`, capping
concurrency at :data:`MAX_TOOL_WORKERS`.

Conflict rules (Mini-ADR L-6, conservative defaults):

* Two ``is_read_only=True`` tools NEVER conflict — even if they touch
  the same path. Pure reads can race safely (no torn writes).
* A read + a write that BOTH declare ``path_args`` conflict iff the
  resolved path sets intersect. Disjoint paths run in parallel.
* A read + a write where at least one has empty ``path_args``
  conflict — the side without a declared path could touch anything,
  so we cannot prove safety.
* Two writes conflict on path overlap; both with empty ``path_args``
  also conflict (they write shared state — ``update_plan`` /
  ``subagent`` style).

The scheduler is greedy: each tool call lands in the earliest stage
that has no conflict with anyone already there. This keeps the total
stage count small while preserving the LLM's intended ordering of
state-mutating calls (``update_plan`` always lands alone, after
prior reads, before any subsequent reads).
