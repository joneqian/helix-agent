"""``ask_for_approval`` builtin tool — Stream J.8 (Mini-ADR J-24).

The agent-initiated half of the J.8 approval design (STREAM-J-DESIGN
§ 14.5). The declarative gate (``PolicySpec.approval_required_tools``)
is platform-enforced; this builtin is the *agent's* own escape hatch —
when it hits a run-time decision point it is unsure about, it calls
``ask_for_approval`` to pause for a human verdict.

The tool is **not dispatched like a normal tool**: ``tools_node``
special-cases a call to it (by name) *before* the parallel staging,
turning it into an :class:`~helix_agent.protocol.approval.ApprovalRequest`
and pausing the run (see ``graph_builder/_approval.py``). This class
exists purely so the LLM sees ``ask_for_approval`` in its tool list;
:meth:`call` is a defensive guard that should never run.
