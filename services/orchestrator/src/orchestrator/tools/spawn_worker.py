"""Dynamic worker spawning — 1.3 Orchestrator-Worker (``spawn_worker`` tool).

Where :class:`~orchestrator.tools.subagent.SubAgentTool` delegates to a
*statically declared* deployed agent (``spec.subagents``), this tool lets the
orchestrator **create an ephemeral worker at run time** from a generated
task + focus — the 2026-mainstream Orchestrator-Worker shape (Anthropic
multi-agent research / Claude Code Task tool / hermes ``delegate_task``).

The worker:

* is built from a *synthesized* spec (the control-plane's
  :class:`WorkerAgentBuilder` derives it from the parent — inheriting the
  parent's model + sandbox isolation, with a generated worker system
  prompt), **not** resolved from a deployed ``agent_ref``;
* runs to completion via the shared child-run core
  (:func:`~orchestrator.tools._child_run.run_child_to_result`), reusing the
  depth cap, cancellation/deadline propagation, L7 trajectory, and
  final-answer extraction;
* is discarded when done — the parent synthesizes its result.

Bounds are platform-global (see ``control_plane.settings``): a per-run spawn
count + a per-run concurrency semaphore live on :class:`WorkerSpawnBudget`,
created once per run and threaded through :class:`ToolContext`. When no
budget is wired (tests / eval), the worker still runs — depth, iteration cap,
deadline, and the per-tenant quota engine bound cost structurally.
