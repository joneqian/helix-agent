"""``bash`` tool — Stream TE-5.

Runs an arbitrary shell command in the agent's gVisor sandbox, confined
to the per-user workspace. It is the "ultimate executor" escape hatch —
git / grep / pandoc / zip / format conversion — that a curated tool set
can't anticipate (TE-ADR-1).

**Design (TE-ADR-1 / TE-ADR-2)** — bash does NOT need a new supervisor
endpoint: it rides the existing ``exec`` channel by wrapping the command
in a tiny ``subprocess`` snippet, so it executes in exactly the same
sandbox (same gVisor boundary, same ``/workspace`` mount, same per-tenant
quota / timeout) as ``exec_python``. The sandbox — not the absence of a
bash tool — is the security boundary; ``exec_python`` already permits
arbitrary execution, so adding bash is an ergonomics win at ~zero
marginal risk.

The command string is embedded with ``repr()`` so it is a safe Python
literal regardless of quotes / newlines / backslashes — there is no
Python-level injection. ``shell=True`` then runs it via ``/bin/sh -c``;
the command's stdout / stderr flow through the snippet's, and the
command's exit code propagates via ``sys.exit`` so the LLM sees the real
shell exit code.

**Governance** — ``bash`` declares ``side_effect="irreversible"``: a
shell command can do anything (``rm -rf`` as easily as ``ls``). Via
TE-4 that makes every bash call forced-serial (never shares a tool
stage) and auto-approval-gated (pauses for human review without needing
to be listed in the manifest's ``approval_required_tools``).
