"""Build the seed-file set for sandbox ``/workspace`` materialization.

skill-runtime §5.1 — an agent's activated skills are materialized at
``/workspace/skills/<name>/…`` so bundled scripts run as authored (the
canonical Agent Skills model: skill = a directory on the VM filesystem).

This runs ONCE at build time (``agent_factory.build_agent``) over the already-
resolved ``SkillVersion`` rows; the result is bound onto the sandbox tools and
sent to the supervisor on each ``acquire`` (the supervisor re-validates path +
caps at its trust boundary). Reuses the same U-21 checks as ``skill_view`` so
seeded bytes can't bypass the scanner:

* **drift** — a row whose recomputed ``content_hash`` doesn't match is skipped
  whole (tampered past the import-time scan).
* **context-scope threat scan** — each text supporting file is re-scanned; a hit
  drops that file. Binary files can't encode a prompt, so they're seeded as-is.

SKILL.md itself is always seeded (it is the ``prompt_fragment`` already injected
into the system prompt) so a skill's relative refs resolve on disk.
