"""Agent factory — assemble a runnable agent from an :class:`AgentSpec`.

Closes the Stream E loop: turns a manifest into something the E.14
``run_agent`` worker can stream. The keystone it depends on is F.6's
:class:`SecretStore` — provider API keys live behind ``secret://``
references, never in the manifest.

M0 v1 scope:

- **LLM routing — real.** :func:`build_llm_router` walks the
  ``ModelSpec`` fallback tree, resolves each provider's key (the platform
  credential via ``provider_key_resolver``; Stream Y-2 ignores any
  manifest-pinned ``api_key_ref`` for agent builds) through the SecretStore,
  builds the matching provider adapter, wraps it in E.12's rate limiter, and
  assembles an :class:`LLMRouter`.
- **Tools — assembled.** The manifest's ``tools`` field is a
  ``type``-discriminated union (Mini-ADR E-14); :func:`build_tool_registry`
  maps each entry to a concrete adapter. Platform runtime deps (Tavily
  client / allowlist provider / MCP pool) are injected via
  :class:`~orchestrator.tools.ToolEnv` — the default empty ``ToolEnv``
  still builds a pure-LLM agent; a declared tool whose dep is missing
  raises :class:`AgentFactoryError`.
- **Middleware chains — assembled.** :func:`build_middleware_chains`
  (Mini-ADR E-15) wires the three always-on middlewares plus any
  env-gated ones (PII / cache / Langfuse) into the graph's anchor
  chains and the router's ``around_llm_call`` chain.

``ModelSpec.temperature`` is plumbed through ``_build_provider`` into
each adapter and onto the request body.

    that turns the agent_factory ``skill_resolver`` callable into the

    Re-fetches at call time so the U-21 drift check sees the LIVE row.
    The build-time snapshot in :class:`_LoadedSkills.resolved_versions`
    is for the summary block only — the tool itself round-trips to the
    store to catch any post-build DB tampering.

    Sprint #4 (Mini-ADR U-29): also forwards the parent ``Skill`` row
    when the resolver supplied it (production callables do; older eval
    callables don't, in which case ``skill`` is ``None`` and the tool
    treats it like an unknown skill — safer than reading an archived
    row through the runtime path).
