"""Stream TE-8 — per-workspace write lock wiring (orchestrator side).

Verifies the tool layer holds the :class:`WorkspaceLock` around the *write*
exec (``write_file`` / ``bash``) and that reads are lock-free. The real
cross-replica behaviour (PG advisory lock serialises concurrent writers) is
covered by the control-plane integration test; here the lock is a recording
double and a probe client asserts the exec ran while the lock was held.
