"""``RetentionCleanupJob`` — the D.3 nightly sweep.

Per STREAM-D-DESIGN § 2.6 + Mini-ADR D-5: M0 walks the rows with
``DELETE ... WHERE ctid IN (SELECT ... LIMIT N)`` rather than partition
drops. Simple, no schema churn, and the per-tenant retention shapes
fit in a single SQL statement using a JOIN with ``tenant_config``.

Three independent passes per ``run_once``:

1.  ``audit_log`` — only ``backup_acked = true`` rows past
    ``audit_retention_days``. Unacked candidates are counted + logged
    so SRE notices when the D.1c worker is lagging; the rows
    themselves are **never** deleted while unacked.
2.  ``event_log`` — past ``event_log_retention_days``. No WORM gate
    in M0 (cold archive to S3 is a Stream G item).
3.  ``jwt_blacklist`` — past ``expires_at``. Global, not tenant-scoped.

The whole sweep runs as ``retention_cleanup_worker`` (migration 0010,
NOLOGIN BYPASSRLS with the minimum delete grants).
