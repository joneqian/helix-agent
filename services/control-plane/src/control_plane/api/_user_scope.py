"""Per-user scope helpers — Stream J.14.

Resolve the calling principal to a ``tenant_user.id`` and enforce
thread ownership for human-user principals.

A thread stamped with a ``user_id`` is private to that user. Machine
principals (service / service_account) and tenant admins keep
tenant-wide access; threads with no ``user_id`` (created before J.14,
or machine-triggered) keep the legacy tenant-scoped behaviour.
