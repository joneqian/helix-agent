"""Reservation reaper — Stream C.5 (subsystems/16 § 5.4 / § 6).

Reservations that never see a ``commit`` or ``release`` call (process
crash, client disconnect, network partition) would otherwise pin
``reserved_total`` budget forever. The reaper scans ``token_reservation``
on a periodic schedule, finds rows in ``RESERVED`` older than the
configured max age, and transitions them to ``EXPIRED`` while refunding
the monthly ledger.

Wiring (in :func:`control_plane.app.create_app`):

* Started from the FastAPI ``lifespan`` ``yield``.
* Stopped via :meth:`stop` from the ``finally`` branch.
* Per-cycle errors are caught and logged — the reaper never crashes
  the process — and increment the
  ``helix_control_plane_quota_reaper_cycle_errors_total`` counter so
  alerting fires on a sustained failure rate.
