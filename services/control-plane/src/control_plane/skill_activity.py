"""``ThrottledActivityRecorder`` — Capability Uplift Sprint #4 (Mini-ADR U-27).

Activity tracking for the Curator state machine. Every ``agent build``
that binds a skill (via ``_load_skills``) and every ``skill_view`` tool
call should mark the skill as just-used so the daily Curator sweep
doesn't transition it to ``stale``.

Naive ``UPDATE skill SET last_used_at = NOW()`` on every call would
amplify writes to the skill row under high agent-build / skill_view
fan-out (e.g. 100 agent runs/sec * 5 skills each = 500 UPDATEs/sec on
a small skill set). The recorder dedupes per-skill writes to once per
``ttl_seconds`` window (default 1 hour) — that's plenty granular for a
state machine measured in days.

Process-local: each control-plane replica throttles independently. The
worst case under N replicas is N writes per skill per hour, which is
still negligible. Cross-process coordination via Redis would be tighter
but not worth the dependency for state-machine-grade time scales.

    model (one coroutine in the lock at a time); not safe under
    free-threaded Python without further work — but the control plane
    runs under the standard GIL'd asyncio loop.

    Process-local: under N control-plane replicas, worst case is N
    SQL UPDATEs per skill per ttl window. The Curator's day-scale
    decisions don't notice the difference.
