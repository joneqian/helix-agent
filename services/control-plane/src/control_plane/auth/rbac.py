"""Role-based access control decision matrix — Stream C.3.

Single source of truth for the ``(role, resource, action)`` → ``bool``
table from ``subsystems/15-authn-authz.md`` § 3.3. Used by route-level
``authorize()`` dependencies.

Design notes
------------

* Decisions are **deny by default** — only explicit matrix entries grant.
* mTLS service principals get a synthetic ``service`` role with read+write
  over internal resources (``quota``); they cannot touch admin resources
  (``user`` / ``role_binding``).
* API-key service-account principals carry their assigned role via
  :class:`helix_agent.persistence.auth.RoleBindingStore` (resolved
  lazily — pulled in C.3 follow-ups). For this PR, scopes from the key
  itself stand in for roles in :func:`_collect_roles`.
* :func:`authorize` is a **pure** function (no IO, no audit) so it can
  be unit-tested in isolation. The audit write happens at the FastAPI
  dependency layer (``require_role``) so denials still leave a trace.
