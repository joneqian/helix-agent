"""Stream N — resolve ``Principal.is_system_admin`` from the role-binding store.

After ``JWTVerifier`` / ``ApiKeyVerifier`` produces a base :class:`Principal`,
``AuthMiddleware`` calls :func:`resolve_system_admin` to query the platform-scope
role-binding for the verified subject. If a row exists, the Principal is
augmented with ``is_system_admin=True`` and ``allowed_tenants="*"`` via
:meth:`Principal.as_system_admin`.

This lookup is **per-request** today (M0). M1 may layer an in-process cache
keyed on ``(subject_type, subject_id)`` with TTL invalidation on
role-binding writes; for now the cost is one indexed PK-style query per
authenticated request.

Mini-ADR N-2 (``docs/streams/STREAM-N-DESIGN.md``):the lookup is gated by
``subject_type`` — only ``"user"`` subjects can be platform admins (M0
restriction;``service_account`` platform admins ship in M1, see
out-of-scope in STREAM-N-DESIGN § 1.2).
