"""Recursive ``str`` walker for trigger-config strict scanning.

See ``docs/streams/STREAM-UPLIFT-DESIGN.md`` § 2.3 (Mini-ADR U-2 Layer A).

Why recursive: trigger ``config`` is ``dict[str, Any]`` and future
schemas may add prompt-bearing fields. A whitelist would silently fail
when a new field lands; the walker covers them by default. Cost: edge
false-positives (e.g. URLs containing directional marks), which we
accept and resolve via runbook tuning.

Why a size cap: a single ``str`` leaf > ``MAX_FIELD_BYTES`` is rejected
**before** scanning to prevent a degenerate-input DoS on the regex
engine (catastrophic backtracking on attacker-tuned payloads).
``10_240`` bytes is generous — K.K12 baseline P99 prompt length is
~2 KB.
