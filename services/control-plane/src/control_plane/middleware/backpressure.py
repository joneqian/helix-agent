"""Application-layer backpressure — Stream 16.3 (subsystems/14 § 6 补强).

OOM / fork-bomb resource exhaustion inside a sandbox is delegated to the
host cgroup (subsystems/14 § 6). This middleware is the *control-plane's own*
overload guard: it fast-fails new requests with ``429`` once too many are
already in flight, so a request flood sheds load at the edge instead of
collapsing the process (memory blowup, event-loop starvation, cascading
timeouts).

Depth signal: :attr:`Lifecycle.in_flight` — the count of requests currently
inside :class:`InFlightMiddleware` (the heavy inner chain: auth already done,
now doing DB / LLM / sandbox work). This middleware sits *outside* InFlight, so
a shed request never reaches auth / DB — the cheapest possible rejection. The
check is a soft cap (a small burst can momentarily exceed it under a race);
that is fine for overload protection, which only needs to bound, not serialise.

Health + metrics paths are exempt: liveness probes and Prometheus scrapes must
answer even while the app is shedding, otherwise the orchestrator kills a busy
(but healthy) replica and the scrape that would explain the overload is lost.
