"""Cancellation middleware — Stream B.3, ADR B-2.

End-to-end target: a TCP-level client disconnect must propagate into the
in-flight handler within ≤ 200 ms (verification gate #3 from
STREAM-B-DESIGN.md).

Implementation note (Starlette interop):

The original B.3 cut polled ``request.is_disconnected()`` from a
background task while sitting inside ``BaseHTTPMiddleware``. That call
issues ``await receive()``, which **consumes the next ASGI message** —
fine for GET / DELETE, but for POST / PUT it ate the request body and
the downstream handler saw an empty payload (caught by Stream B.5).

The middleware is now a **raw ASGI app** that wraps ``receive`` once,
intercepts ``http.disconnect`` messages on their natural arrival, and
forwards every body message unchanged. The :class:`CancelToken` is
published via ``scope["state"]`` so ``request.state.cancel_token`` /
``request.state.cancel_reason`` work identically to the previous
implementation.

The ``poll_interval_s`` constructor arg is kept for API compatibility
with B.3 callers but is unused — the wrapped-receive pattern reacts to
disconnect events directly, so a poll cadence is unnecessary.
