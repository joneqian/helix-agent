"""Per-tenant remote MCP server pool — Stream V-D (Mini-ADR V-4).

A tenant's registered remote MCP servers (``tenant_mcp_server``) are built
into a per-tenant :class:`MCPServerPool` on first use and reused across agent
builds. The pool is invalidated (closed + dropped) when the tenant's registry
changes (the registration API calls :meth:`invalidate`) and all pools are
closed at app shutdown (:meth:`close_all`).

Decoupling: the orchestrator never imports this — the agent builder receives a
``Callable`` provider bound to this service (mirrors ``mcp_allowlist_provider``).

        that fails to connect is skipped (logged, no tenant-derived values) so

        is hit the just-opened client is closed before breaking — it was never

        Generation counter guards the lost-invalidation race: ``invalidate``
        bumps the generation under ``_locks_guard`` while a build may be

        **retried** (audit #2). Serving the invalidated pool would hand the
