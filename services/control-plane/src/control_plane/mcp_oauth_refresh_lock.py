"""Cross-replica MCP OAuth refresh lock — Stream MCP-OAUTH (OA-6 hardening).

OAuth access tokens are refreshed lazily at per-user pool build. The pool's
in-process ``asyncio.Lock`` serialises refreshes *within one replica* only —
across **multiple control-plane replicas** (the production HA topology) two
replicas can refresh the same connection concurrently. When the authorization
server rotates the refresh token (RFC 6749 §6 / OAuth 2.1), the second refresh
presents an already-rotated refresh token, the AS replies ``invalid_grant``, and
the connection is wrongly marked ``revoked`` — an intermittent production failure
that scales with the number of OAuth users.

:class:`PgMcpOAuthRefreshLock` closes that gap with a Postgres **transaction**
advisory lock keyed on ``{tenant}:{user}`` — only one replica refreshes a given
user's connections at a time; the others block, then reload and find the token
already fresh. It mirrors :class:`PgWorkspaceLock` (``pg_advisory_xact_lock``,
auto-released at commit, safe under PgBouncer transaction mode) with two
differences:

- **Its own ``classid`` (2)** in the two-arg advisory key space, namespaced away
  from workspace locks (``classid`` 1) so the key spaces never collide.
- A **modest idle/statement timeout** (covers one discover+refresh HTTP round
  trip held inside the lock) rather than the workspace lock's 360 s — refresh is
  seconds, not a 300 s sandbox exec.

Taken on a *raw* (non-RLS) session: it touches no tenant table; isolation comes
from the ``{tenant}:{user}`` key.
