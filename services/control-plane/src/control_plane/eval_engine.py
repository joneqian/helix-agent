"""``RunBaselineEvalEngine`` — P1-S2.1c (production eval engine adapter).

Bridges the :class:`EvalWorker`'s neutral :class:`EvalEngine` Protocol to
the existing capability-eval engine (``tools/eval/run_baseline.py``). The
worker stays decoupled: it knows only :class:`EvalCaseOutcome`; this
adapter maps the engine's ``CapabilityReport``s onto them.

``run_baseline`` is imported lazily inside :meth:`run` — only environments
that actually execute an eval need the ``tools/eval`` harness on the path,
and a missing harness surfaces as a per-run error (the worker isolates it
to ``status=error``), never an import-time crash of the control plane.
