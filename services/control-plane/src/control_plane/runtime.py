"""In-process agent execution runtime — control-plane ↔ orchestrator glue.

The control-plane runs the orchestrator as a library (in-process
monolith, STREAM-E-DESIGN § 2.6): an agent graph executes as a
background ``asyncio.Task`` in this process, streaming events to the
SSE client through a :class:`StreamBridge`.

:class:`AgentRuntime` bundles the three long-lived pieces a run needs —
the run-lifecycle registry, the SSE event bridge, and the
manifest→agent build path — behind one object held on ``app.state``.
