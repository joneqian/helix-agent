"""P1-S2.1d-2 — ``EvalWorker`` lifespan wiring.

The drain worker is gated by ``enable_eval_worker`` (OFF by default). When
armed it lands on ``app.state.eval_worker`` and runs; the lifespan stops it
on shutdown. With the flag off, nothing is wired — the enqueue API still
works (it only writes ``queued`` rows), there is just no resident drainer.

Driven through ``app.router.lifespan_context`` (the same boot path the ASGI
server uses), mirroring ``test_checkpointer_wiring``. The default interval
(300s) means the loop sleeps first, so no ``tools/eval`` harness is touched.
