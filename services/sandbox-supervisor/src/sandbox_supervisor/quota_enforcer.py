"""``QuotaEnforcer`` — per-workspace volume quota gate (Stream J.15-补强-1).

STREAM-J-DESIGN § 9.5.1 + Mini-ADR J-29 第 1 项. The supervisor calls
:meth:`check` at acquire time (after the workspace row is resolved, before
the docker launch) to reject acquires that would exceed the
``size_limit_bytes`` ceiling; and :meth:`refresh_size` fire-and-forget
at release time to write the latest ``du`` back into the store so the
next check has a fresh basis.

Design notes:

* Acquire-time check is a **read** of ``workspace.size_bytes`` — no
  filesystem walk on the hot path. The freshness of that value depends
  on :meth:`refresh_size` being scheduled after each release.
* :meth:`refresh_size` swallows all errors — it's best-effort. The
  worst case is the next acquire sees a stale value, which is exactly
  the failure mode the OS-level ENOSPC fallback (Mini-ADR J-29 第 3 项,
  host LUKS / cloud-disk quota) is there to catch.
* Soft-deleted workspaces (``deleted_at IS NOT NULL``) are rejected at
  :meth:`check` time — Mini-ADR J-36 lifecycle 第 2 档 says a soft-
  deleted workspace's acquire is rejected.
