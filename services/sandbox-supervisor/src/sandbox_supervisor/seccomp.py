"""Fail-closed validation of the pinned seccomp profile — Stream HX-10.

The :class:`SandboxRuntimeProvider` forwards the profile path verbatim and
stays Docker-free / pure (test matrix #43). The *fail-closed* contract lives
here and runs once at supervisor startup: a configured profile path that is
missing or not valid JSON is a security misconfiguration — not a transient
fault — so the supervisor must refuse to start rather than silently fall back
to the host default profile (HX-K2: security-config events are the exception
to the fail-open axiom).
