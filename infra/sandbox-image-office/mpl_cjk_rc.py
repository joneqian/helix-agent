"""Bake a CJK-capable default into matplotlib's system matplotlibrc (build-time).

Run once during the office image build (OFFICE-ADR-3). It rewrites the rc
shipped in matplotlib's mpl-data so that *every* agent's matplotlib code
renders Chinese without per-call font configuration — important because the
runtime rootfs is read-only and /workspace (the only writable mount) is
wiped each session, so a user-level rc would not persist.

Debian's ``fonts-noto-cjk`` ships ``NotoSansCJK-Regular.ttc`` (a collection);
matplotlib registers only its first face, whose family name is
"Noto Sans CJK JP". That face is part of the unified Noto Sans CJK typeface
and contains the full Han set, so it renders Simplified Chinese correctly —
we list several CJK family names so a matching one resolves regardless of
which face matplotlib happens to register.
