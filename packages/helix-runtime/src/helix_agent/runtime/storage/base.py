"""``ObjectStore`` Protocol — S3-compatible object storage abstraction.

Per [ADR-0004](../../../../../../docs/adr/0004-object-storage.md). All
call sites depend on this Protocol, not the S3 client directly, so the
in-memory implementation can stand in for unit tests and a different
S3-compatible backend (MinIO / Aliyun OSS / AWS S3 / Tencent COS) can be
swapped via the factory without code changes.

**Multipart upload deferred** to M0 follow-up (per ADR § 3). M0 first cut
handles small objects only; ``put`` takes ``bytes`` rather than a stream.

Stream D.1b extends ``put`` with optional S3 Object Lock parameters
(``retain_until`` + ``lock_mode``) used by the D.1c audit WORM backup
worker. See STREAM-D-DESIGN § 2.3 + Mini-ADR D-2.

    The S3 / MinIO contract is **version-level**: each put creates a
    new version, and the compliance lock pins that *version* against
    delete-before-expiry. Same-key re-puts are not rejected by S3 —
    they just produce new versions. The in-memory store models the
    simpler, key-level semantic ("this key is locked, you cannot
    overwrite") because it doesn't track versions; that gives unit
    tests a clean way to assert "the lock is active" without needing
    to plumb version ids.

    Practical use: the D.1c WORM-backup worker keys by audit row id
    (monotonic), and uses ``backup_acked`` in the DB — not put-side
    rejection — to avoid double writes on retry. Both backends meet
    the worker's needs because the worker doesn't re-put under the
    same retention.

          ``compliance`` cannot be overridden by anyone.
