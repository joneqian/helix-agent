"""Topologically-ordered middleware chain bound to a single anchor.

The chain is built once at boot (or test fixture setup) and reused for
every invocation; per-invocation cost is one ``terminal`` wrap pass
proportional to the number of middlewares in the chain.

Build via :meth:`MiddlewareChain.from_middlewares` — direct ``__init__``
takes the pre-ordered tuple and skips validation, suited for callers
that already know the order.
