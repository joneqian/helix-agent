"""Errors raised when building or invoking a :class:`MiddlewareChain`.

Per [STREAM-E-DESIGN § 3 Mini-ADR E-2](../../../../../../../docs/streams/STREAM-E-DESIGN.md),
configuration errors are surfaced at chain construction (boot time) rather
than at the first request — that way a misconfigured stack fails startup
loud instead of dropping into prod with a partial chain.
