# Modifications:
#   - In-memory per-process registry; Mini-ADR J-41 adds a durable
#     RunStore mirror (agent_run table) so run status survives the
#     5-minute TTL sweep + control-plane restarts
#   - run_id / thread_id typed as UUID (helix-agent convention)
#   - Added tenant_id (ADR-0002 + Stream C.4 RLS) + user_id
#   - Dropped assistant_id / multitask_strategy / metadata / kwargs —
#     run queueing / retry / DLQ are J.10 work (Mini-ADR J-26)
#   - Lock retained from DeerFlow; mutations are serialized
# Last sync: 2026-05-11
