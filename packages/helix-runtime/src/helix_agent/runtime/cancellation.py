"""Cooperative run cancellation — Stream E.15.

A :class:`CancellationToken` is the orchestrator's cooperative-cancel
primitive. "Cooperative" means cancellation surfaces only at explicit
checkpoints — node entries and the LLM / tool ``await`` boundaries —
never via a hard kill (Mini-ADR E-9: hard kill leaves half-written
checkpoints / half-sent SSE events; SIGKILL is the F.7 sandbox
supervisor's job, not the orchestrator's).

Two surfacing mechanisms:

- :meth:`raise_if_cancelled` — a synchronous checkpoint. Nodes call it
  on entry so a run cancelled between steps stops immediately.
- :meth:`run_cancellable` — wraps a single ``await`` (an LLM call, a
  tool dispatch). It races the awaited coroutine against the cancel
  signal; if cancel wins, the in-flight coroutine is cancelled and
  :class:`RunCancelledError` is raised — so a 30-second LLM call is
  interrupted within one event-loop tick of the cancel, not after it
  finishes.

The token is backed by an :class:`asyncio.Event`. Production wires it
to a run's ``RunRecord.abort_event`` via :meth:`from_event`, so
``RunManager.cancel`` and the token share one signal. The token is
threaded to graph nodes through ``config["configurable"]`` — **not**
through ``AgentState`` — because a live :class:`asyncio.Event` is not
checkpoint-serialisable, and every TypedDict state channel is
checkpointed.

Per [STREAM-E-DESIGN § 2.7](../../../../../../docs/streams/STREAM-E-DESIGN.md).
