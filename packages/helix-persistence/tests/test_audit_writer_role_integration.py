"""Integration: ``audit_writer`` role + REVOKE UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE.

Pins the D.1a contract (STREAM-D-DESIGN § 2.2 + Mini-ADR D-1):

1.  An application role that has been ``GRANT``ed ``audit_writer`` can
    insert into ``audit_log`` via :class:`SqlAuditLogStore.append` —
    because ``append`` does ``SET LOCAL ROLE audit_writer`` inside the
    write transaction.

2.  Without ``SET LOCAL ROLE`` the same application role can NOT issue
    a raw ``INSERT`` either (defense-in-depth: even if a future caller
    bypasses ``SqlAuditLogStore`` it cannot quietly write rows from the
    default role).

3.  ``UPDATE`` / ``DELETE`` / ``TRUNCATE`` are blocked at the DB layer
    for the application role no matter which role is active — those
    grants were never given to anyone but the table owner. Even
    ``audit_writer`` itself doesn't have them.

4.  The new ``backup_acked`` column defaults to ``false`` and is
    nullable for ``backup_acked_at``; the partial index ``audit_log_
    backup_pending_idx`` exists.

The bootstrap user that ``testcontainers`` ships is a superuser and
would silently bypass every check above, so we provision a fresh
``helix_app`` LOGIN role for this test, narrow its grants on
``audit_log`` to just ``SELECT``, and then ``GRANT audit_writer TO
helix_app`` so it can assume the writer role.

      ``permission denied`` we want to surface. Production deployments
      should provision their app role the same way.

    * GRANT SELECT on ``audit_log`` (so reads / verification still work)
