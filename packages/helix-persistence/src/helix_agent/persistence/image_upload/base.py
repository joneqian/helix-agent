"""Abstract ``ImageUploadStore`` repository — Stream J.6.补强-3 (Mini-ADR J-32).

Implementations:

* :class:`helix_agent.persistence.image_upload.memory.InMemoryImageUploadStore`
* :class:`helix_agent.persistence.image_upload.sql.SqlImageUploadStore`

The store is scoped by ``tenant_id`` at the application layer; the SQL
implementation also applies a tenant RLS policy (migration 0028) so a
forgotten WHERE clause cannot cross-leak.
