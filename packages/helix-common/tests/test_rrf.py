"""Tests for :mod:`helix_agent.common.search.rrf` — Sprint #6 Mini-ADR U-6.

Mirrors the original ``_rrf_fuse`` coverage from
``services/orchestrator/tests/test_knowledge_tool.py`` plus generic /
edge-case scenarios that come with extraction:

- Generic over hashable types (UUID / dataclass / str).
- Empty inputs.
- Single-list identity.
- Duplicates inside one list collapse.
- Custom ``k`` parameter affects ordering.
