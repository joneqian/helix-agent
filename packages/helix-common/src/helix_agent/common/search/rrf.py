"""Reciprocal Rank Fusion — Mini-ADR U-6.

Pure algorithm extracted from ``orchestrator/tools/knowledge.py`` so it
can be shared between J.5 RAG hybrid retrieval and the Sprint #6 memory
hybrid recall path.

Reciprocal Rank Fusion combines several ranked lists by scoring each
item with ``Σ 1/(k + rank)`` across the lists it appears in. An item
ranked well by every list rises to the top; ``k`` (default 60, the
canonical value from Cormack/Clarke/Buettcher 2009) dampens the weight
of the very top ranks so a single list cannot dominate the fusion.

The function is generic over the item type — any hashable type works
(``MemoryItem`` / ``KnowledgeChunk`` / ``UUID`` / dataclasses with
``frozen=True``). Callers keep ownership of comparison semantics.

    multiple lists rise to the top. Items appearing in only one list
    are still kept, ranked by their position in that list.
