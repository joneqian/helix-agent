"""Spotlighting — prompt-injection defense for untrusted content (Stream PI-1).

Model-agnostic, black-box first line against **indirect prompt injection**:
content that helix knows is untrusted (tool results, retrieved memory/RAG,
ingested documents) is wrapped before it reaches the model so the model can
tell *data* from *instructions* and ignore commands embedded in the data.

Two techniques from Microsoft's Spotlighting paper (arXiv 2403.14720),
combined:

- **delimiting** — wrap the content in randomized, unguessable markers
  (``«UNTRUSTED nonce=…» … «/UNTRUSTED nonce=…»``). The nonce is per-run so
  untrusted content cannot forge the closing marker to "escape" the region.
- **datamarking** — interleave a marker glyph (``▁``) into the content's
  whitespace so an injected instruction loses its natural token boundaries,
  making it read as data rather than a command.

The matching system-prompt instruction (:data:`SPOTLIGHT_SYSTEM_CLAUSE`)
tells the model what the markers mean. Encoding (base64) — the paper's
strongest mode — is intentionally NOT used: it inflates tokens and some
regional models parse encoded text poorly, hurting utility.

This module is pure + deterministic (the caller supplies the nonce), so it
unit-tests without a model and the wrapped output is prompt-cache stable
within a run.
