"""Remote-URL validation — SSRF guard for tenant-supplied MCP server URLs.

A tenant registers a remote MCP server by URL; the control plane then
*connects out* to that URL (registration probe + runtime tool calls). An
unchecked URL lets a tenant point the platform at internal services or the
cloud metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254) — a classic SSRF. This guard is
applied at every connect-out site (registration, probe, runtime).

The check is static (scheme + IP-literal ranges + localhost names). It does
NOT resolve DNS, so it does not stop DNS-rebind (a hostname that resolves to a
public IP at check time and a private one at connect time). By decision, that
defense lives at the infrastructure egress layer (deny RFC1918 / loopback /
link-local egress from the control plane), NOT in this module — see
ADR-0009. This static guard is the defense-in-depth first layer: it blocks the
common cases (literal private IPs, localhost, metadata IP) cheaply.
