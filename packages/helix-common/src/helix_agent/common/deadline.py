"""Deadline hierarchy + cancellation — Stream A.13.

Design: subsystems/28-reliability-primitives § 3.3 / § 5.4.

Five-layer nested timeout per § 5.4::

    request > session > step > tool > llm

``DeadlineContext`` carries an **absolute** unix-ms deadline (not a
relative duration) so it survives serialization across services without
network-latency drift; the receiver re-computes ``remaining_ms`` against
its local clock. Each ``with_deadline()`` block derives a child with a
budget that is auto-clipped never to exceed its parent.

``CancelToken`` is the user-driven cancellation channel — orthogonal to
the time-based ``deadline_ms``. The most common reason a request ends
early is "user closed their tab" (cancel), not "took too long"
(deadline). The two live in the same context so any await point can
check either one.

This module is **framework-agnostic** by design — the FastAPI
middleware that injects the root ``DeadlineContext`` from
``X-Helix-Deadline-Ms`` headers lands in Stream B, and the
``HelixHttpClient`` that propagates them outbound is also Stream B work.
A.13 ships the primitive that those layers wire up.
