"""Service lifecycle + graceful shutdown — Stream A.12.

Design: subsystems/28-reliability-primitives § 3.2 / § 5.3.

State machine::

    STARTING ──ready──▶ RUNNING ──SIGTERM──▶ DRAINING ──in-flight=0──▶ STOPPING
                          ▲                     │
                          │                     ▼
                          └─── liveness fail ───┘  (k8s restart)

Each service constructs **one** :class:`Lifecycle`, registers ``on_drain``
+ ``on_cleanup`` hooks during startup, then hands the instance to its
ASGI handler / supervisor for the SIGTERM hookup (Stream B).

**In-flight counter**: ``Lifecycle.in_flight()`` is an async context
manager that increments on enter / decrements on exit (in ``finally``).
``graceful_shutdown`` waits for the counter to reach zero before
proceeding to cleanup, bounded by ``drain_timeout_s``.
