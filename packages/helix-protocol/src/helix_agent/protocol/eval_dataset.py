"""J.12 学习 / 反馈闭环 — DTOs.

Mini-ADR J-19 / J-27 / J-43 (STREAM-J-DESIGN § 17). J.12 is the
*curation* layer: a background worker turns L7 trajectories + G.6
feedback into :class:`CurationCandidateRow` rows; a human promotes
reviewed candidates into :class:`EvalDatasetRow` rows — the curated
dataset J.13 consumes.

These DTOs are the wire shape between the curation worker, the curation
stores, the curation / eval-dataset CRUD API, and the export CLI.
