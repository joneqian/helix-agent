    seen ``bind`` or ``view`` activity for ``tenant_config.skill_stale_days``

    version *and* auto-revive the skill to ``ACTIVE`` via the
    ``bump_last_used_at`` SQL — the "asleep, wake on touch" semantic.
    Distinct from ``DRAFT`` so operators can tell "never published" from
    "published but went cold".

    ``ARCHIVED`` — retired skills; bare ``name`` references reject at
    build time but historical pinned ``name@N`` references still resolve
    (reproducibility — agents pinned to old versions keep working).
    Sprint #4 makes this auto-reachable from ``STALE`` after
