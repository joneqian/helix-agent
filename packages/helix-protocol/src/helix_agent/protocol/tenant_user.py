"""``tenant_user`` row shape — Stream J.14 (per-user scope).

A *user* is a principal (a human, or a service account) acting within a
tenant. The canonical product form is per-user: each user owns a
persistent agent instance — conversation, long-term memory, workspace.
``tenant_user`` is the registry that makes "user" a first-class entity.

``(tenant_id, subject_type, subject_id)`` is the natural identity key;
``id`` is the surrogate ``user_id`` that owned tables (``thread_meta``
today, memory / workspace / artifact in later Stream J sub-items)
reference. Hard isolation stays at the tenant boundary (RLS); ``user_id``
is a first-class ownership column scoped at the application layer
(STREAM-J-DESIGN Mini-ADR J-1).
