"""Stream K.K14 — replay audit-log rows from the WORM object-store backup.

Used in the recovery runbook (``docs/runbooks/audit-restore.md``): if
the live ``audit_log`` table is destroyed or corrupted, this helper
walks the WORM bucket prefix that the audit-backup-worker writes to
and re-inserts the JSON records into a *restore* table (default
``audit_log_restored``). The operator decides whether to swap that
table into the live name or query side-by-side.

The serializer is the worker's own
:mod:`audit_backup_worker.serialization`, so the file shape this
module reads is the same one the worker wrote — no schema drift.

Inputs:

* ``object_store`` — any :class:`ObjectStore` (S3-compatible in
  production; the in-memory store covers the drill test).
* ``prefix`` — usually ``"{tenant_id}/"`` to scope the restore;
  empty string restores everything in the bucket.
* ``writer`` — a callable invoked once per row with the parsed dict.
  Production binds it to an asyncpg INSERT; the drill test binds it
  to a list.append.

Returns a small :class:`RestoreReport` with the count + a list of
keys that failed to parse (the operator can pull them by key and
investigate).
