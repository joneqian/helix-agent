"""J.1 plan_execute eval — Stream J.13a (M0 baseline).

Drives :func:`orchestrator.graph_builder.planner.parse_plan` (a pure
function) against a curated dataset of ``(task, llm_reply)`` pairs.
Two metric axes per Mini-ADR J-37 (the only capability where LLM-judge
is in scope):

* ``pass_rate`` — structural validity. A case passes when
  :class:`~helix_agent.protocol.Plan.goal` contains every keyword the
  case lists *and* :class:`Plan.steps` has at least ``min_steps``
  entries. Both the well-formed cases and the fallback cases must
  satisfy this — the planner's "any malformed reply degrades to a
  single-step plan wrapping the task" guarantee (Mini-ADR J-3a) means
  ``min_steps=1`` is a meaningful floor.
* ``judge_mean`` — quality score 1-5 from a :class:`JudgeProvider`.
  CI uses :class:`ScriptedJudge` (per-case scripted scores from the
  YAML); the weekly 周跑 swaps in :class:`AnthropicHaikuJudge` via
  :func:`make_judge_from_env` (Mini-ADR J-39).
