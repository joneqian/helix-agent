/**
 * First-run setup SDK — backed by ``/v1/setup`` (platform bootstrap).
 *
 * Both calls are **pre-authentication**: they run before any platform
 * system_admin exists, so no Bearer token is attached. The status probe
 * is unauthenticated; the bootstrap POST is gated by a one-time
 * ``X-Setup-Token`` header (the ``HELIX_AGENT_SETUP_TOKEN`` the operator
 * set at deploy), not by a session.
 *
 * The shared ``apiClient`` only *attaches* a Bearer when one is stored,
 * so it is safe to reuse here — the status probe / bootstrap simply
 * carry no Authorization header when the browser has no token. We go
 * through ``apiClient`` directly (rather than ``postJson``) for the POST
 * because we need a custom ``X-Setup-Token`` header; the envelope is
 * unwrapped the same way ``client.ts`` does.
