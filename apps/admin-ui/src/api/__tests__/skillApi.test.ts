/**
 * SkillApi adapter tests — skill-authoring-ia Phase B.
 *
 * The adapter is mostly thin delegation; the one piece of real logic is the
 * platform ``renameSupportingFile`` which the server has no route for, so it
 * is composed put-new + delete-old (put first so a failure leaves the
 * original intact).
